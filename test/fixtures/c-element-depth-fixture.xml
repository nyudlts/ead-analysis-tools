      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>The administrative records of the Office of the Chancellor and Executive Vice President
        span the years 1952-1966. The records were processed in ten different segments for the
        purpose of student assignments. The material has now been merged into one cohesive
        collection, and access is provided by this guide. The records consist of correspondence,
        circular memoranda, minutes, reports, meeting notes, policy statements and analyses,
        evaluations, press releases, printed material, newspaper clippings, surveys and
        questionnaires, and a few photographs. Original order - alphabetical in most instances - has
        been maintained, and the series generally reflect the manner in which the documents were
        originally filed. Folder contents have been arranged chronologically. </p>
      <p>The collection has been divided into five subgroups, representing each of the Chancellor
        and Executive Vice Presidents, with the exception of David Henry and Carroll Newsom, who
        have been combined into one subgroup due to the paucity of the Newsom material and an
        inability, in some cases, to differentiate between tenures (see series note below). In
        addition, a small portion of records generated in the final months of the George Stoddard
        administration were originally interfiled with the bulk of the Russell Niles' papers and
        have been maintained that way for reasons of continuity and logic (see series note below).
        Within each subgroup the material has been further divided into series and subseries
        according to original order. Series titles generally reflect the original file titles and
        have been changed only when it was necessary to highlight a particular grouping and
        facilitate access without disturbing the inherent arrangement.</p>
      <p>The last series, Additional Accession, contains records from all five C/EVPs. Within each
        subgroup the material has been further divided into series and subseries according to
        original order. Series titles generally reflect the original file titles and have been
        changed only when it was necessary to highlight a particular grouping and facilitate access
        without disturbing the inherent arrangement.</p>
      <p>The adminstrative records of Henry and Newsom span the years 1942-1964, with the bulk of
        the material created from 1952-1956. The scant number of records attributed to Newsom
        suggest that he took many of his files with him upon being elected President of NYU in 1956,
        leaving records that were indistinct or closely linked to the files of Henry, as in the case
        of the educational television series. The records of Henry contain some gaps as well; not
        all files seem to cover his full term in office. </p>

    <bioghist id="aspace_074d4d004a7126e349115ef6116d8ae4">
      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Upon taking office in 1951, Chancellor Henry T. Heald began to centralize administrative
        functions. He found the administration's history of making decisions based on budgetary
        demands to be at odds with the goals of an institution for higher learning. Heald sought to
        develop a policy emphasizing essential educational objectives at a time when the
        University's rapid growth threatened academic development. In order to preserve the
        accomplishments achieved through expansion and at the same time execute greater control over
        educational policy, Heald bolstered the ranks of the central administration by appointing in
        1952 David D. Henry to the newly created position of Executive Vice Chancellor. Henry
        assumed the duties of the discontinued Office of the Provost and served as the chief
        educational officer of the university. Shortly thereafter, Heald appointed an assistant to
        the Executive Vice Chancellor for University Development.</p>
      <p>The grant-funded New York University Self-Study Plan, an exhaustive analysis of NYU's
        policies and practices, outlined a new administrative organization as part of a
        comprehensive, long-range plan. In affirming centralized authority, the self-study prompted
        the revision of executive titles: the Chancellor became the President, Vice Chancellors
        became Vice Presidents, and the University Council became the Board of Trustees. </p>
      <p>In 1960, the Board of Trustees amended the bylaws to change the title of the Executive Vice
        President to Chancellor and Executive Vice President (C/EVP). Although the new title did not
        bring with it a change in duties, it more accurately reflected the C/EVP's position as
        second in command, while indicating that the Office of the C/EVP was endowed with NYU's
        original conception of the Chancellor: the head of faculty, the chief liaison between
        faculty, students, and Board of Trustees, and the officer to recommend faculty.</p>
      <p>The C/EVP served as the academic alter ego of the President. As chief of University
        Operations, the C/EVP supervised schools and divisions, student housing, special programs,
        relations with the State and Federal Departments of Education, and training programs like
        the now defunct ROTC. The C/EVP was in charge of most "internal organizational problems,"
        and also attended to related educational activities outside the immediate needs of the
        university, such as educational television and various research projects. In addition, the
        C/EVP oversaw the Academic Council (later changed to the Dean's Council, then the Committee
        of Deans), a small advisory group resulting from a self-study recommendation and consisting
        of high ranking officers who are each "responsible for a major segment of the university's
        educational program, as to policy and administration." In addition, the Office of
        Institutional Research and Educational Planning operated until 1975, under the authority of
        the C/EVP. The C/EVP office was dissolved in 1977.</p>
      <p>David Dodds Henry, 1952-1955</p>
      <p>David Dodds Henry was named the first Executive Vice Chancellor of NYU in September 1952.
        During his tenure he served as chairperson of the Metropolitan New York Educational Agencies
        Committee on Television, and two other committees on educational television, sponsored by
        the American Council on Education. In addition, he was a member of the Special Committee for
        Rubber Research of the National Science Foundation, and a member of the National Planning
        Association. Henry frequently lectured on educational television, the use of computers in
        education, and the university in an urban environment. In 1955 Henry left NYU to assume the
        presidency of the University of Illinois. </p>
      <p>Carroll Vincent Newsom, 1955-1956</p>
      <p>In July 1955, Carroll Newsom was appointed to succeed David Henry. Newsom brought a
        distinguished career as a mathematics professor and administrator to NYU. He was
        subsequently elected president of the University at the time of Henry Heald's resignation in
        September 1956. Newsom resigned as President in September 1961 and became a senior Vice
        President at Prentice Hall Publishers. </p>
      <p>John Eli Ivey, Jr., 1957-1959</p>
      <p>John Ivey, formerly a sociologist at the University of North Carolina, was appointed
        Executive Vice President of NYU in March 1957. Ivey supported many special projects and
        exploratory programs at NYU, expanding his position and the scope of the central
        administration. He resigned in September 1959 and later became Dean of the College of
        Education and Professor of Sociology at Michigan State University. </p>
      <p>George Dinsmore Stoddard, 1960-1964</p>
      <p>George Stoddard, a psychologist and former president of the University of Illinois, came to
        NYU in 1953 after diplomatic service with the post-war educational mission to Japan. Before
        becoming Chancellor and Executive Vice President in January 1960, Stoddard directed the NYU
        Self-Study and served as Dean of the School of Education. He played a central role in
        constructing a new hierarchy of administrative offices that centralized educational policy
        and budgetary control. In 1964, Stoddard resigned to become Distinguished Professor of
        Education. </p>
      <p>Russell Denison Niles, 1964-1966</p>
      <p>Russell Niles' long association with NYU began in 1929, when he joined the University as an
        assistant law professor. He became Dean of the School of Law in 1948, and was named
        Chancellor and Executive Vice President in February 1964. He resigned in 1966 to become
        President of the Bar of the City of New York. Niles continued many of the policies of
        Stoddard, and was an important influence in helping to further centralize and strengthen the
        administration. </p>

          <p>The administrative records of David D. Henry and Carroll V. Newsom span the years
            1948-1956, with the bulk of the material having been created between 1952-1956. The

            <p>Records in the administrative subseries consist primarily of correspondence that
              lends insight into Henry's and Newsom's interaction with the University community,
              particularly Henry's strong relationships with other administrators, including
              President Henry Heald. The series contains information on the Edwin Berry Burgum case,
              the English Professor who was dismissed as a result of a House Un-American Activities
              Committee (HUAC) investigation of his alleged membership in the communist party (Box

              deferment on the grounds that he was performing valuable research (Box 6/Fldrs.
              15-16). In addition, the files contain information on land acquisitions (Box 6/Fldr.
